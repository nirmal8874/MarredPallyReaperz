# Marredpallyreaperz

This Application will help reignite the Good old days from marredpally. 
Our Team is working on creating on one stop shop for all the problems marredpally basketball players & Hyderabad ball lovers faced during their hey days.

Marredpally Reaperz will automate the process of basketball Tournament Creation (Earlier Orginizations had to place ads, word of mouth etc) into a Pub-Sub Pattern where every Subscriber gets notificed as soon as there is Tournament Announced.

We are creating a Player Profile (It can help display Player image + Description) to display when players checkin to the cournt and substitute etc.

Automating Score Cards keeping (Earlier originizers had to manually keep adding and keep score cards and later it was fed into systems and papers). 


Coaching Tool during Time out and many more.

In short We desire to create a Marredpally Nba Website that can be accessed on the Mobile and solves all problem with Automation.
